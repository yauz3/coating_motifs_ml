## 📂 What Is *Not* Included (Important)

⚠️ **Experimental nanoindentation data are NOT included in this repository.**

Due to **copyright and data ownership restrictions**, the raw indentation datasets **cannot be publicly redistributed**.

All data usage in the associated manuscript complies with institutional and publisher policies.

## 🧪 Pipeline Overview

The typical workflow is:

1. **Raw indentation tables**
2. Layer-wise concatenation → **continuous through-thickness coordinate**
3. Parsing of categorical layer labels into:

   * `ybsi_pct`
   * `mullite_pct`
   * `si_pct`
4. Synthetic feature construction:

   * Device-signal transforms
   * Depth coupling
   * Composition–mechanics interactions
   * Hybrid template deviations
5. Feature selection (ANOVA F-test, training-only)
6. Model training (Motif E)
7. Evaluation on unseen motifs (A–D)
8. Post-processing:

   * Neighborhood smoothing
   * Layer-mean aggregation
9. Interpretation:

   * SHAP
   * Clustering
   * Feature networks

## ▶️ Running the Code

> **Note:** You must first place the experimental CSV files (obtained via request) into the expected data directory.

Example execution order:

```bash
python 1_preprocess_and_concat.py
python 2_feature_engineering.py
python 3_feature_selection_anova.py
python 4_train_models.py
python 5_evaluate_cross_motif.py
python 6_shap_analysis.py
python 7_feature_clustering.py
```

Script names may vary depending on the exact analysis stage; see inline documentation in each file.

## 📈 Outputs

The pipeline produces:

* Depth-wise hardness predictions
* Smoothed hardness profiles
* Layer-mean hardness predictions
* Performance metrics:

  * R²
  * MAE
* SHAP importance plots
* Feature dendrograms
* Feature correlation networks
* CSV summaries for publication figures

---

## 📌 Reproducibility Notes

* Feature selection is **fit only on the training motif** to prevent leakage
* Identical feature sets are applied to all test motifs
* Ensemble models use **fixed equal weights**
* No hyperparameter tuning is performed on test motifs

---

## 🧠 Intended Use

This repository is intended for:

* Academic research
* Methodological comparison
* Extension to other multilayer / graded ceramic systems
* Educational purposes in materials informatics
